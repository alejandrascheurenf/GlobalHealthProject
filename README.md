# Global Health Analytics

## Background
Global health is a critical area of study, focusing on understanding health outcomes and disparities across different regions and demographics. This project analyzes a dataset on global health indicators, including life expectancy, mortality rates, disease prevalence, and healthcare resources, to uncover key insights into worldwide health trends and challenges.

## Business Task
Analyze global health data to identify disparities, trends, and areas of concern, and propose actionable insights to improve health outcomes globally.

## Business Questions
1. **What regions have the highest and lowest life expectancy, and what factors contribute to these disparities?**
2. **Which diseases or health conditions are most prevalent in different regions?**
3. **How do healthcare resources (e.g., hospital beds, physicians) correlate with health outcomes?**
4. **Are there significant trends in mortality rates over time?**
5. **Which regions are most impacted by preventable diseases, and what interventions could help?**

## Tools
- **Python:** Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Visualization, and Data Analysis
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Scikit-learn (for predictive modeling)

## Data Set
The dataset used for this analysis is publicly available on Kaggle and contains information on various global health indicators. It includes data on life expectancy, healthcare resources, mortality rates, and more.

## Methodology
This project follows these key steps:
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Address missing data, inconsistencies, and outliers.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Use summary statistics and visualizations to uncover trends and patterns.
3. **Statistical Analysis:** Examine relationships between variables such as healthcare resources and health outcomes.
4. **Visualization:** Create engaging visualizations to effectively communicate insights.
5. **Predictive Modeling (Optional):** Use machine learning models to predict specific health outcomes.

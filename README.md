# Global Health Analytics

## Background
Global health is a critical area of study, focusing on understanding health outcomes and disparities across different regions and demographics. This project analyzes a dataset on global health indicators, including life expectancy, mortality rates, disease prevalence, and healthcare resources, to uncover key insights into worldwide health trends and challenges.

## Business Task
Analyze global health data to identify disparities, trends, and areas of concern, and propose actionable insights to improve health outcomes globally.

## Business Questions
1. **What regions have the highest and lowest life expectancy, and what factors contribute to these disparities?**
2. **Which diseases or health conditions are most prevalent in different regions?**
3. **How do healthcare resources (e.g., hospital beds, physicians) correlate with health outcomes?**
4. **Are there significant trends in mortality rates over time?**
5. **Which regions are most impacted by preventable diseases, and what interventions could help?**

## Tools
- **Python:** Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Visualization, and Data Analysis
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Scikit-learn (for predictive modeling)

## Data Set
